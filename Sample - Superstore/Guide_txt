# Step_by_step
# Data Cleaning 
1. we will be using any sample dataset(CSV or Exel)

# Data cleaning and Prepration
 #hear we will bw using panda and  Exel 
1. lets first fic the dataTypes 
2. Lets handle some missing values

# Data Storage
1. after the data cleaning is done lets store it in a exel file
2. pandas acn also be used for processing

# Tools required 
1. PowerBI or Tablue (i will go with powerBI )
2. connecting the cleaned data
3. build visuals


# now
creating a file "xyz.py" to keep the clean data set
here we use pandas lib
now importing pandas as pd
. now first read the file
. print every possible values available in dataset
. here are some "df.head()" prints the 5 rows in the table 
  "df.shape" prints the shape of the dataframe 
  "df.column" prints the column present in the data
  "df.dtypes" it gives the data types of the column
  "df.isnull() it give the total null values
  
  After data is loded 

# now data Cleaning
. converting the date" which is in string to real date time  " pd.to_datetime" 
 this converts "1/01/20016" to 2020-10-03 00:00:00
 . no lets add asome new column SYNTAX = df["new column"] <- this adds the new colunm
